# EEG-Data-PAC-Processing
Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) is a metric extensively used in neuroscience to evaluate the relationship between the phase of low-frequency oscillations and the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations within neural signals. It offers valuable insights into the coordination and interaction of various frequency components in the brain.
